*How to install:*

for debian & debian-based distros such as Ubuntu & Mint

    sudo apt-get install git gettext python-mako python-mutagen python-requests python-lxml

for fedora and similar:

    yum install git gettext python-mako python-mutagen python-requests python-lxml

Then install the plugin:

cd coverart-browser
sh ./install.sh

*For Ubuntu 12.04 & 12.10:*

This is now available in my rhythmbox PPA - installation instructions in this AskUbuntu Q&A:

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

For Ubuntu 12.04 users that have upgraded to Rhythmbox v2.98 using the webupd8 PPA, this version 
of rhythmbox crashes when used with python plugins such as coverart-browser and replaygain.

It is strongly recommended that you either upgrade to 12.10 where v2.98 works great, or 
downgrade to v2.96 or v2.97 as per:
 - http://askubuntu.com/questions/201093/how-do-i-downgrade-rhythmbox-v2-98

*installation for embedded coverart*

The plugin makes use of the package `python-mutagen`.  For most distros, the default package is v1.20 which was released in 2010.

Since then, lots of bug fixes have been resolved.  If you know that there is coverart embedded, but is not displayed
in our plugin, then you should install the very latest package:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install mutagen
</pre>
