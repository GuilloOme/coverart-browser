GTK3 port of code.google.com/p/rhythmbox-cover-art-browser

How it works:

1. Click the new CoverArt source button (left hand side of screen)
2. Albums are displayed as clickable buttons containing their album cover
3. Right click menu option to play, queue & search for cover art for an album.

How to install (64bit linux distro users only):

1. install git
N.B. for debian - sudo apt-get install git
2. git clone https://github.com/fossfreedom/coverart-browser.git
3. cd coverart-browser
4. sh ./install.sh

N.B. 32bit users have a bug that prevents querying the database - this prevents this plugin from working.  Sorry!

Notes:

 - this is a port of the GUI cover-art browser capability.
