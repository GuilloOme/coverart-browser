UNDER DEVELOPMENT - Feel free to look & help out!
Basics work - at least I think it does :)

Browse your cover-art albums in Rhythmbox

GTK3 port of code.google.com/p/rhythmbox-cover-art-browser

How it works:

1. Click the toolbar button
2. Albums are displayed as clickable buttons containing their album cover
3. Double-click the cover to play the album.

Notes:

 - this will be a port of the GUI cover-art browser capability.
 - Drag-drop, cover-search and right-click copy is unlikely to be ported

Random Musings:

1. Consider when double clicking the album whether to create a playlist to play the album from or like currently just to wipe the Queue and add the tracks from the album
2. May be add a right click option to queue or create a playlist the album
3. Maybe hover over the album to display important facts - number of tracks, duration etc.  Have a look how clementine/banshee handles this
4. Possible right click and display all tracks in a submenu to allow you to play a given track.

Other random stuff.

1. Integration with other plugins - e.g. WebMenu via right-click - should be useful
2. If the destination drop is enabled for the buttons then maybe possible to drop from file-manager a JPG to update the cover
3. May be allow multi-select of buttons, right click and add selected albums to the queue/playlist
