1. install *git*
N.B. for debian based distros - `sudo apt-get install git`
2. install the package *gettext*
N.B. for debian based distros - `sudo apt-get install gettext`

<pre>

git clone https://github.com/fossfreedom/coverart-browser.git
cd coverart-browser
sh ./install.sh
</pre>

*For Ubuntu 12.04 & 12.10:*

This is now available in my rhythmbox PPA - installation instructions in this AskUbuntu Q&A:

http://askubuntu.com/questions/147942/how-do-i-install-third-party-rhythmbox-plugins

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

For Ubuntu 12.04 users that have upgraded to Rhythmbox v2.98 using the webupd8 PPA, this version 
of rhythmbox crashes when used with python plugins such as coverart-browser and replaygain.

It is strongly recommended that you either upgrade to 12.10 where v2.98 works great, or 
downgrade to v2.96 or v2.97 as per:
 - http://askubuntu.com/questions/201093/how-do-i-downgrade-rhythmbox-v2-98

You can use this plugin with v2.98 but you'll need to change the file *coverart_album.py* and
comment out the following lines (i.e. add a # as shown)

<pre>
#self.entry_changed_id = self.db.connect('entry-changed',
#            self._entry_changed_callback)
</pre>

If you do this, rhythmbox does not crash - however, if you change and album or track details
via the properties option in the music pane, these changes are not updated in the plugin until
you restart rhythmbox.


**Please help out with translating**

We need you to help us translate the english text to your native language.

Don't worry - it is easier that you think.

Instructions are in the file TRANSLATE_README. Post a link to the file as a new issue, or
if you are feeling generous - fork and push a pull-request. Thanks!

If they look scary - just email me (foss dot freedom at gmail dot com) and I'll send you the 
file that needs to be translated - it is less than 20 text strings so it should only take a
few minutes.

When emailing - tell me your locale & language.  You can find these by typing:

    echo $LANG
    echo $LANGUAGE
