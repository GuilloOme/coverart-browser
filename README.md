UNDER DEVELOPMENT - Feel free to look & help out!
Basics work - at least I think it does :)

Browse your cover-art albums in Rhythmbox

GTK3 port of code.google.com/p/rhythmbox-cover-art-browser

How it works:

1. Click the toolbar button
2. Albums are displayed as clickable buttons containing their album cover
3. Double-click or press space to play the album.
4. Right click menu option to queue an album.

How to install:

1. install git
N.B. for debian - sudo apt-get install git
2. git clone https://github.com/fossfreedom/coverart-browser.git
3. cd coverart-browser
4. sh ./install.sh

Notes:

 - this is a port of the GUI cover-art browser capability.
 
Random Musings:

1. Possible right click and display all tracks in a submenu to allow you to play a given track.
2. Integration with other plugins - e.g. WebMenu via right-click - should be useful
3. If the destination drop is enabled for the buttons then maybe possible to drop from file-manager a JPG to update the cover
