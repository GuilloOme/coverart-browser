*How to install - Rhythmbox 3.0 and later:*

N.B. for earlier Rhythmbox versions use version 1.x

Prerequisite is to use a distribution supporting GTK 3.10 or later - for example, Ubuntu 14.04, Arch or Fedora 20

for debian & debian-based distros such as Ubuntu & Mint:

    sudo apt-get install git gettext python3-mako python3-lxml python3-gi-cairo python3-cairo gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad rhythmbox-plugins

for fedora and similar:

    sudo yum install git gettext python3-mako python3-lxml python3-cairo

NOTE: it is assumed that you have separately installed the patent encumbered codecs found in the good/bad & ugly packages
To install the plugin:

<pre>
rm -rf ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/coverart_browser
git clone https://github.com/fossfreedom/coverart-browser.git
cd coverart-browser
./install.sh
</pre>

To uninstall the plugin:

<pre>
cd coverart-browser
./install.sh --uninstall
</pre>

Note 1 - the CoverArt Browser plugin also requires installing the following plugin:
